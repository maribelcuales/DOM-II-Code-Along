/////   DOM II  /////
// By Grabriel Cabrejas 


/* 
// Chrome can make events: 
- click, double click, scroll, load, etc. 

// When a user interacts on a page, hundreds of events are being triggered. 

// Project: DOM II
- https://github.com/maribelcuales/DOM-II-Project

// Events
- When we click(e.g) the home nav link, there's just one target.  
- The target is the innermost thing which we clicked 
- NOTE: AN EVENT HAS ONE TARGET  
*/ 


/////   Event Listener    /////

// .addEventListener() 
// - is a method which we can invoke on document, window, HTML elements 

// Register events/functionalities to happen later

// addEventListener works on elements, document, and window

/*
/// Chrome on event listeners (e.g click) ///
- Chrome knows when the click happens 
- It invokes the eventListener
- It injects into the eventListener as the argument of the function injects all kinds of information about the event that fired (e.g type, etc.)

	console.log('The header got clicked');

/////   CAPTURE PHASE   /////

// Win > Doc > HTML > body > header > nav > a
// - the phase where the event travels through the DOM starting at the very top (window) all the way down to the target (a)
// - no listerners are executed 
// - the event just travels down the DOM all the way to the anchor tag 


/////   TARGET PHASE    /////
// - when the event reaches the target = the event listener/listeners on the target fires up! 

/////   BUBBLER PHASE   /////
// - the event will start traveling up the DOM all the way back the way it came tripping all the wires 
// - the event BUBBLES UP  

// Interview: What is the BUBBLING PHASE? 
// - "Code registers event handlers(e.g click handlers). Then comes the user with a mouse and clicks on a thing, an event object gets created by chrome containing all the information about the event including the target which is the innermost thing that got clicked. This object enters the DOM starting at the top and travels all the way down to the target or the innermost thing that got clicked (e.g button).This is the CAPTURE PHASE. Once it reaches the taret, the event listener/s on the button fires and then we start tripping wires (TARGET PHASE). We start going back up trippping wires if there are any at every step all the way back. This phase where the event goes back up the DOM tripping wires that is the BUBBLING PHASE."



// Some event listeners have come with default event listeners (e.g a link's href) 

// Solution: preventDefault()
// - mechanism we can use to prevent the default behavior from happening 
// - mainly to impede some legacy behavior of certain HTML elements (e.g forms tend to reload the page when we hit submit, preventDefault() prevents this)

/*
function clickEventHandler(event) {
	event.preventDefault(); 
	console.log(event.type + '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!');
	console.log(event.target);  
}

/////   EVENT HANDLERS/LISTENERS    /////  
// you can grab ANY element in the DOM
// you can do ANYTHING you want with it
// you can create new elements and attach them to the DOM

// you can destroy any part of the website
// Caution! (Webpage will be gone!)
// document.body.innerHTML = "<div>gone</div>";

// you can trigger network requests to send data to the server
// animations 
// analytics 
// responsive design 

////// ============     ============ //////     

function clickEventHandler(event) {
	event.preventDefault(); 
	console.log(event.type + '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!');
	console.log(event.target);  
	console.log(event.currentTarget);

homeLink.addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler);
document.querySelector('nav').addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler);
document.body.addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler);
document.addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler);
window.addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler);

// header will launch during capture phase 
document.querySelector('header').addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler, true);

// A variaton of code above (launching header during capture phase) 
/*
document.querySelector('header').addEventListener('click', clickEventHandler, {capture: true});
*/

// NOTE: It is RARE though that an event listener will execute during capture phase 


// Prevent the BUBBLING PHASE 
// SELDOM GOOD REASON TO DO THIS; DON'T DO THIS 
document.querySelector('a').addEventListener('click', event => {
	// we are going to sabotage bubbling
	event.stopImmediatePropagation(); 
  console.log('hahaha, sabotaging propagation!!!');
})


// NOTE: "It's normally a bad idea to disrup the noraml flow of events." 


/* 
// OTHER EVENT LISTENERS: 

Load 
- it's common to use the Load Event and shove the entire application we're writing in the callback of the load event because that makes sure that our JS doesn't run until the website is fully rendered     
*/


/*
// [ Event Listeners ]  
- The tracking process and subsequent action taken is called an event listener. We put.addEventListener
an event listener on an element and give it a callback. When that event is triggered on the element, the callback is run.

Events
- mouse events (click , etc.) and many others 
- We can add event listeners for as many events as there are for each element
- We can listen for a mouseclick, keypress, hover, and more all on the SAME element. 
-  Although to do so we need to call .addEventListener and pass in a callback for each one.


/////   .addEventListener   /////
- syntax: 
element.addEventListener('click', callback); 
or 
element.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  //Handle event
});

- The cb is also calles as the 'EVENT HANDLER'
- The cb will take a single argument; this is known as the Event Object


/////   The callback and the Event Object   /////
- The callback (also known as an event handler) will take a single argument; this is known as the Event Object. 

- This is a Javascript Object and contains all we need to know about the event and the element it happened on.

- One of the most important properties of the event object is .target
- This property will give us all of the info about the DOM node where the event happened. 
- It has many of the same properties as a regular DOM node, .children, .parent, .style, innerText, etc. We can use these properties to manipulate the element itself, or itâ€™s relatives.

- Sample: Manipulate the target to change the background color: 
element.addEventListener('click', (event) => { event.target.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'; });


/////   Event Propagation   /////
- When we look at a DOM tree we can see those child elements are nested inside parent elements, like a pyramid. And, like a pyramid, if you stand(trigger an event) on a child element, you are also triggering that same event on every parent element all the way up to the body. 

-  If you have an event of the same type on a parent element and a child element, and you trigger that event on the child element, it will also trigger on the parent. We have to be careful not to create unwanted interactions because of this. In the future, you may consider this is a feature, for now, this is something we would like to avoid.


/////   .stopPropagation()    /////   
- In our event handler, we are passed the event object. 
- The event object has lots of methods and properties on it including one called:  .stopPropagation() 

- if we call this method in our event handler, it will effectively stop our event from bubbling any further up the chain.
eg: 
const eventHandler = (event) => { event.stopPropagation() };


/////   .preventDefault   /////   
- Some elements have a native default reaction to certain events. For example, form elements will refresh the page on submit. 
- .preventDefault is a method on the event object
- it will stop an HTML element from reacting in its default way. 
- .preventDefault will be used less than .stopPropagation, but it is important to know about as well.
