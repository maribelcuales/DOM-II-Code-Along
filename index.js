// Chrome can make events: 
- click, double click, scroll, load, etc. 

// When a user interacts on a page, hundreds of events are being triggered.

// Events
- When we click(e.g) the home nav link, there's just one target.  
- The target is the innermost thing which we clicked 
- NOTE: AN EVENT HAS ONE TARGET
